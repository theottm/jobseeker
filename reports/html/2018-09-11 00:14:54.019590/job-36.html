About Us</b></p>
<p>
Have a look at www.seerene.com and get to know Seerene a little better. Seerene is a deep tech spin-off of Hasso Plattner Institute. After some years of intense research, Seerene was founded in 2015 and started to sell its SaaS platform in the same year. We are more than 80 employees worldwide located in Potsdam, Berlin, New York, San Francisco, London and Hong Kong. Here's a short description of the platform we've created:</p>
<p><i>
While companies have management systems for finance, human resources, and sales, CIOs haven't traditionally had that same transparency. Seerene's code+people management platform sets a new standard for how global CIOs manage their codebases and engineering capacity. It lets them see across thousands of projects to understand effort, productivity, and quality. With fact-based KPIs they can accelerate time to market and increase their pace of innovation.
