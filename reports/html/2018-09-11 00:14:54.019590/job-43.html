Babbel
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span id="job_summary" class="summary">Founded in 2007, Babbel is the world's top-grossing and most effective language-learning app. No small feat, and no small challenge. In a moment rife with talk of walls, we're building bridges — making the language-learning journey as exciting and empowering as possible, helping people forge new connections and participate in worlds bigger than their own. We do things that matter. And foremost, we make people speak their new language as they've always wanted to. Come work with us.
<br><br>
There's still so much to do.
<br><br>
Babbel is for everyone, not some niche or elite strata of learners. Everyone. As our user base has grown, so has what they need from us. Their learning needs, life experiences, and reference points become more varied and colourful by the day. Meeting that means ensuring users see themselves reflected —not just in our product— but the world it allows them to imagine with us. That means reflecting the dynamism and diversity of our users, as much as possible, in the production of Babbel. We currently have 600 people from more than 50 nationalities working in our Berlin and New York offices, challenging and learning from each other at every step. A culture of difference and dignity is critical to how we've connected with millions of users, in every hemisphere
