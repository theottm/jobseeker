<span id="job_summary" class="summary"><p><b>Who we are</b></p><p>Arweave’s mission is to create a global, immutable hard drive on a new type of blockchain.

We’re building products in-house like our Chrome extension crypto wallet, as well as working with external partners to plan and deliver products, and building technical tools to support the rest of the team. We’ll need someone who is flexible and happy to work across disciplines and projects - sometimes you’ll be designing and building a website using frontend tech, sometimes we’ll need tools building to help monitor our network using some backend tech hosted on AWS or similar. We’re a small team doing big things, so we go fast and break things.</p><p><b>What you’ll do</b></p><p>You’ll be located in our Berlin office and work closely with the core team, but should be able to work independently and be self-directed.</p><p>Primarily designing, developing, and testing Javascript based applications that work with the Arweave immutable storage network. The role is flexible and you’ll be given freedom to give your input and proactively shape our products and processes. You’ll be involved in all aspects of the development cycle from initial ideas, gathering requirements, prototyping, development, deployment and maintenance.</p><p>The Arweave network is accessible over a JSON based HTTP API which lets us develop applications using traditional web technologies, so you’ll need to be experienced with core frontend technologies like JS, HTML, CSS, have experience with some backend languages e.g. Python, PHP, Node, Go, etc, database technologies like MySQL, and have general *nix server admin skills. Knowledge about AWS and cloud services would be useful.</p><p>As our current and planned products are mainly Javascript SPAs you’ll need experience with:</p><ul><li>Strong practical knowledge of ES6</li><li>Practical experience of using Vue.js, React, Angular, or similar JS frameworks along with Vuex/Redux or some other similar state management pattern</li><li>SASS/SCSS or LESS</li><li>Webpack, Gulp, Grunt or similar build tools and preprocessors</li><li>Git, testing and CI tools</li></ul><p>We aim to open source as much as possible, so attention to detail is important and you’ll be responsible for ensuring code is of high quality and well documented.</p><p>An eye for design is needed as you’ll be building and shaping user interfaces. Some understanding of blockchains would help but this can be learnt on the job.</p><p>The role will be based in our office in Berlin. We are looking to fill the position immediately.</p><p><b>To apply, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us via email at kyle [at] arweave.org.</b></p><p><b>About Us</b></p><p>By providing permanent, low-cost, and truly censorship-free data storage for everyone, we strive to democratise the information space.
