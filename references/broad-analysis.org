* Approches
There are two approches to keep in mind.
** stathead / qualitative
use available data, stats and probability
** scout / quantitative
Get humanly involved in the question to avoid using data science where it is not needed and to know where it can be of cruitial help. Helps keeping DS work pertinent.
* Project management
How do I overcome :
** Time constraints
*** run test / small steps / prototypes
** Limits
what is shaky about this approach ?
*** quantitative unknown
**** former predictions / insights : find and evaluate
**** trending/ubiquitous ideas/concepts
*** is it useful ?
**** what would be the user case ?
***** for individuals : orientation

****** data science / computing
***** select exciting data sources
***** readings
****** signal and the noise
